<h2>Saving</h2>

<h3>Step 2 of 5</h3>

<p>The "Save password" dialog displayed on screen now will allow you to save the username and password you just typed.</p>

<p>Please save it into your password database before proceeding.</p>

<div class="info"><p>There are other ways to store a new password in Kee but filling in the details directly into the login form as you have just done is by far the easiest and almost always the correct approach. You can find more details in the manual.</p></div>

<div class="instruction">
<p>Save the login entry and then press the "Complete step 2" button.</p>
</div>

<form action="/step3/" method="post"><br/>
  <input type="submit" value="Complete step 2"/>
</form>
