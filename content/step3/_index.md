<h2>Filling</h2>

<h3>Step 3 of 5</h3>

<p>Kee will monitor the websites that load in your web browser and whenever it looks like there is a form for logging in to the website, that form will be automatically filled in with your login details for the site. You can see your login details have been filled into the form at the bottom of this page.</p>

<div class="info"><p>Kee has many options to adjust this automatic form filling behaviour. You can change the behaviour for all or just some of your logins and even block Kee from filling in forms in specific web pages if you have advanced requirements. You can find more details in the manual.</p></div>

<p>You can also store more than one login for each website if required. However, for this tutorial, we will now modify the single login that you just saved - something you'll need to do from time to time when changing the password used to log into a website.</p>

<p>A typical password change process follows this pattern:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Load the website's "change password" page</li>
	<li>Ask Kee to generate a new secure password, paste it into the website's "new password" form field and save the change</li>
	<li>Go to the website's login page (Kee will auto-fill it with the old password)</li>
	<li>Paste the new password over the old one</li>
	<li>Login to the website and then tell Kee to update your password database</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no "change password" page for this tutorial website, so we'll use the login form below to give you a chance to use the two Kee features you'll need: Generating a new secure password and storing the updated information.</p>

<div class="instruction"><ol>
	<li>Generate a new password using one of these methods:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
		<li>Click the "Generate new password" button on the Kee menu (click the Kee button on your toolbar)</li>
		<li>Use the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl-Shift-4</li></ol></li>
	<li>Paste the new password into the password field below</li>
	<li>Click "Complete step 3".</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<form action="/step4/" method="post"><br/>
    <label for="username">Username:</label><input type="text" name="username" id="username"/><br/>
    <label for="password">Password:</label><input type="password" name="password" id="password"/><br/>
    <input type="submit" value="Complete step 3"/>
</form>
