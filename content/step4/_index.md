<h2>Updating</h2>

<h3>Step 4 of 4</h3>

<p>You've used your fake credentials to sign in to our imaginary website. What could be more exciting? Perhaps pretending to change the password!</p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to update your password but we'll walk you through the one that we think offers the best balance of simplicity, speed and safety.</p>

<div class="info"><div><img src="/images/glasses-solid.svg" width="40" height="40"/></div><div><p>You need to change your password in two places - the website or app you are using, and your password manager. Kee makes this as easy as possible but unfortunately there is no safe and secure technical way to do this in a single step and some websites introduce additional barriers to complicate the process. Always remember to change the password in both places and you'll have no problems.</p></div></div>

<div class="instruction"><ol>
	<li>Use Kee to generate a new password for the entry and save it. This step is demonstrated below:
	<p class="instruction-callout"><img src="/images/passwordUpdate.gif" width="410" height="540"/></p></li>
	<li>Paste the new password into the two New password fields below</li>
	<li>Click "Complete step 4".</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<form action="/step5" method="get">
    <label for="username">Username:</label><input type="text" name="username" id="username" autocomplete="off"/>
    <label for="password">Current Password:</label><input type="password" name="password" id="password" autocomplete="off"/>
    <label for="password">New password:</label><input type="password" name="new-password1" id="new-password1" autocomplete="new-password"/>
    <label for="password">New password (Repeat):</label><input type="password" name="new-password2" id="new-password2" autocomplete="new-password"/>
    <input type="submit" value="Complete step 4"/>
</form>

<h4>More tips for changing website passwords</h4>

<p>Don't switch tabs or make other changes to your password database while in the middle of this process. Doing so may leave you in a situation where you'll have to manually look through your entry history and copy and paste old usernames and passwords to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>If your chosen secure password is not accepted by the website, you can always use the History feature of your password manager to view or revert to previous versions of your Kee entry to regain access to your account</p>
