<h2>Saving</h2>

<h3>Step 2 of 5</h3>

<p>The "Save latest login" feature will allow you to save the username and password you just typed.</p>

<p>Click the Kee button (logo) on your browser toolbar and select "Save latest login" before proceeding.</p>

<div class="info"><div><img src="/images/glasses-solid.svg" width="40" height="40"/></div><div><p>There are other ways to store a new password but filling in the details directly into the sign-in form as you have just done is by far the easiest and almost always the correct approach.</p></div></div>

<div class="instruction">
<p><b>Save the entry</b> and then press the "Complete step 2" button.</p>
</div>

<form action="/step3-old" method="get"><br/>
  <input type="submit" value="Complete step 2"/>
</form>
