<h2>Welcome to Kee</h2>
<p>This website will show you how to use Kee to easily and securely manage your passwords. This should take only a few minutes to complete and save you lots of time every day.</p>

<h3>Step 1 of 5</h3>

<p>Kee will offer to remember your login information so you don't have to.</p>

<div class="instruction">
<p>Type a username and password into the boxes below and then press the "Complete step 1" button.</p>
</div>

<form action="/step2/" method="post"><br/>
	<label for="username">Username:</label><input type="text" name="username" id="username"/><br/>
	<label for="password">Password:</label><input type="password" name="password" id="password"/><br/>
	<input type="submit" value="Complete step 1"/>
</form>

<div class="info"><p>You can still go through the tutorial if you have made customisations to Kee options but some instructions might not make perfect sense.</p></div>

<div>If you're having trouble and any advice at the top of the page is not helpful, you can find detailed <a href="https://github.com/luckyrat/KeeFox/wiki/en-%7C-Troubleshooting">troubleshooting advice in the manual</a>.</div>
